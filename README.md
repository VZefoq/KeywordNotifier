# KeywordNotifier
This is a BetterDiscord plugin that notifies you whenever specific keywords (such as DD, XZ, Dragon, etc.) are mentioned in selected Discord servers or channels. You can customize the keywords, server IDs, and channel IDs from an easy-to-use settings panel. It also plays a notification sound when a keyword is detected!
